## Teaching #001: The Nature of True Happiness

### Content:
True happiness is not something that comes from outside. It is your very nature. When you realize this, you stop chasing happiness in the external world and start recognizing the joy that is already within you.

Happiness is not an achievement; it is a recognition. It is not something you have to create; it is something you have to uncover. When the mind becomes calm and the heart becomes pure, this natural state of joy surfaces.

Many people think happiness depends on circumstances, but this is not true. Circumstances are like weather - they keep changing. But your inner nature of joy remains constant like the sky, which is always blue even when covered by clouds.

The secret is to not seek happiness, but to remove what is covering your natural state of joy. Stress, worry, anger, and fear are like clouds that hide your inner sunshine. Through spiritual practices like meditation, breathing, and service, these clouds naturally dissolve.

Remember: You are not seeking happiness - you are happiness seeking expression.
